# One Mag 

This magazine is a special kind, it talks a bit more about different topics not short of business, technology and ecology.
There are more such as entertainment and phycology but they lean more into the binary side of life. What One Mag seeks to
achieve is awareness of the changing events in life far ahead of its time. There is a lot going on in the world, but it is
wise to be able to filter out the noise and concentrate on what really matters.

# Features
 - ### Image magnification on homepage
  <img src ="img/screenshots/magnification.png" alt="Homepage">

  This feature is only available on desktops or rather devices with a screen resolution over 1024px of width. This prevents the use of fingers to magnify content which gets blocked by the finger itself when reading. It works best using a mouse that disappears and leaves the magnification boundary.

   - ### Responsiveness for mobile devices

  This feature triggers when the screen resolution is below 1024px of width. This removes the picture based background and replaces it with a gradient for better processing, it also removes image magnification on the homepage and also makes sure works are not too larger and images are not out of place.

   - ### Count down timer

  This feature shows a timer till which the next magazine is going to be released, giving the audience a timed expectation and duration of the next release. Beware, the counter could change at any moment, creating content is a large task. 

   - ### Play music
  While this feature is in its early stages, the website on the homepage and the reading pages is able to play music is you click the button "P" to play, "S" to stop and "M" to mute. Only Fur Elise by Beethoven will play but as development progresses, there will be a broader scope to choose from.

   - ### Reading the mag

  When a user clicks the read button on the homepage, they are taken to another page which flips through it page of the magazine without redirecting them to another page, on desktop, not fully utilizing the entire screen but on mobile it makes sense because there is one page per view, this feature works just fine for now but will improve later in development.
