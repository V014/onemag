                Business has always been the biggest driver of economics
                from the beggining of time. The chain of human life 
                depends on the power of money and what drives the 
                economy. A keen interest drove me into a research
                to find out what really drives the economy and there
                were many facts depending on my environment. It changes
                reapidly and with the times. Being an open system, it 
                relies on the changes of the envionment and responds 
                acordingly.

                This magazine illustrates the most common methods of
                conducting underrated business practices that could
                underline the problems in making an efficent working 
                atmosphere. Written with an open mind to how the industry
                works, this should open discussion onto what is accurate 
                or not, due to the fact that a good number of people are
                born into the business envionment and are already determined 
                to be the customer. Breaking free from the chain to be
                the suppler or retailer could be a challenge that needs 
                efficient analysis.
