                    Business has always been the biggest driver of economics
                    from the beginning of time. The chain of human life 
                    depends on the power of money and what drives the 
                    economy. A keen interest drove me into a research
                    to find out what really drives the economy and there
                    were many facts depending on my environment. It changes
                    rapidly and with the times. Being an open system, it 
                    relies on the changes of the environment and responds 
                    accordingly.

                    This magazine illustrates the most common methods of
                    conducting underrated business practices that could
                    underline the problems in making an efficient working 
                    atmosphere. Written with an open mind to how the industry
                    works, this should open discussion onto what is accurate 
                    or not, due to the fact that a good number of people are
                    born into the business environment and are already determined 
                    to be the customer. Breaking free from the chain to be
                    the suppler or retailer could be a challenge that needs 
                    efficient analysis.

                    In the end, we may conclude that business is in our 
                    nature. The urge to exchange goods to improve each
                    other's lives has been there. Though with the complex
                    nature of the world these days, good practice has never 
                    been harder to find or achieve. Quality products and 
                    services are even harder to come by. A time where 
                    discipline and good ethics has been long forgotten. It 
                    seems that the folks that uphold the up most quality 
                    tend to keep the mystery of success to themselves while 
                    presenting their earnings at once. The truth being we 
                    could all be a better part of ourselves, but with the higher
                    demand of self care at cost. It seems that it would be 
                    more logical for one to cater for their needs first before
                    others. This is where One Magazine tries to change th minds
                    of people who need empathy in what they do to change the 
                    world for the betterment of humanity.
