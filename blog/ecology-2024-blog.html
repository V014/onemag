                    Before the rise of the mechanical age, vegetation 
                    was abundant. It still is but at this dwindling 
                    rate, by the time the world hit 2024, we will notice
                    the atmosphere fighting hard to keep itself stable
                    with difficulty. This is evident of the way people 
                    use and replenish the land. I a matter of few years
                    the earth will warm up at a rate that we wonâ€™t be 
                    able to withstand.

                    It is in our nature to build and create that did
                    not exist, but it is starting to become harder to
                    give back what we took. Our generation is more tuned
                    to making sales and profit that embracing the life of 
                    everything that surrounds us. The animals we co-exist
                    with are having a hard time surviving when we feel 
                    threatened by the fact that our population is growing 
                    compared to theirs. This leave some animals going extinct
                    some becoming our meals and some becoming our pets and 
                    property in national parks and at home.

                    Specific people cannot be held accountable but us all
                    as a species need to play our part in giving back to the
                    soil. We have earned a lot from it and we owe it our sweat
                    and tears. The result of allowing it to degrade is the heat
                    wave that the entire planet has been facing. This not only
                    heats up the north and south pole, it adds water into the 
                    oceans. This means more flooding in some areas, and some areas
                    will lack water. In other areas, there is a late turn in of 
                    rain. This means crops will suffer if planted on schedule. 
                    People will have to be more flexible to get with the times.
