                    People spend a good portion of their time being 
                    entertained, through out the lifespan of human
                    civilization, there has been countless forms of
                    entertainment. From dance and art, all the way to 
                    music. But for each form, there is evolution of 
                    technique to which the entertainment takes form. 
                    This issue shows how that entertainment has shifted
                    between culture and time.

                    To reduce the strain on production, music and fashion
                    has been merged into one issue. Sometimes people get
                    entertained by the clothes we wear. As part of this I 
                    dedicated sections depicting this. Depending on the 
                    reception, fashion might return but the chances are 
                    my sense of fashion is subjective to prospective and 
                    body build. This tells us that what I might see cool, 
                    the next person will not see it the same.

                    Artists has been mentioned but mainly from the year 2023,
                    so much has changed and people have evolved as well. The 
                    next issue will capture the milestones artists have taken
                    during 2025 and where music is going from there. I have also
                    dedicated a section on music production showing young artists
                    what it's like to create music as a team. Most of the time
                    people like to work alone and truely it could be left to be
                    desired. Abstract music shows how music is a blend of culture
                    and it should not die out because someone did not want to
                    share their prospective.
